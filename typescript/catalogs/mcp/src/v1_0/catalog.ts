 * The MCP catalog as far as it needs no host input: the `McpApp` component and the data
 * transformation functions, ready to hand to a `MessageProcessor`. `callMcpTool` needs the host's
 * MCP client and message processor, so a surface that calls tools uses a catalog built with
 * `createMcpCatalogFunctions`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * new Catalog(MCP_CATALOG_ID, '1.0', [...mcpCatalog.components.values()], createMcpCatalogFunctions(resolver, processor))
 * ```
 *
 * A surface that mixes `McpApp` with other components needs one catalog holding every component
 * it uses; build it the same way from this catalog's `components` and the others'.
