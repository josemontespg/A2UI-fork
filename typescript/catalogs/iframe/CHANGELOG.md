# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add the `@a2ui/catalog-iframe` package: the sandbox proxy asset with its configuration
  (`configureSandbox`, `resolveSandboxUrl`), the `FrameHost` interface and the `WebAppFrameBridge`
  host bridge with allowlist validation, data model sync, function calls and sizing.
  [#2797](https://github.com/a2ui-project/a2ui/pull/2797)
- Add `iframeCatalog` with the `WebAppFrameUrl` and `WebAppFrameSrcdoc` universal components, which
  render their content in the sandbox proxy and connect it to the surface through `WebAppFrameBridge`,
  plus `SandboxedFrameElement` and `ComponentContextFrameHost` for catalogs that add their own
  sandboxed frame components. `@a2ui/web_core` and `lit` become peer dependencies. [#2798](https://github.com/a2ui-project/a2ui/pull/2798)
- Add the `srcdoc-tip-calculator.json` catalog example, with an end-to-end test under
  `tests/examples/` that runs it through the real sandbox proxy. [#3008](https://github.com/a2ui-project/a2ui/pull/3008)
